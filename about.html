    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Parkavi â€” a B.Tech student in Information Technology at MVIT Puducherry (2023â€“2027),
      with a minor in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. I've developed a strong passion for backend development and AI-driven systems,
      and Iâ€™ve already built a small AI project that sparked my deeper interest in intelligent application design.
      My focus is on creating purposeful, scalable web solutions that combine logic with innovation.

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>
      I see development as more than just writing code â€” it's a creative process for building smart solutions that solve real-world problems.
      I approach each project with curiosity, precision, and a desire to learn.
      Whether Iâ€™m integrating AI into my stack or deploying web tools with clean architecture,
      I value impact, user experience, and continuous growth through hands-on exploration.

    <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>
    <p>
      Starting from foundational programming in C and Java to mastering backend frameworks like Flask,
      my academic and personal projects have been a playground for exploration.
      I've created web apps that leverage AI models, designed responsive portfolios, and troubleshooted environments like Ubuntu â€”
      each challenge shaping me into a more thoughtful developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've also taken pride in sharing my knowledge through presentations and tech talks,
      where Iâ€™ve motivated peers and showcased my commitment to skill development.
      From writing API documentation to deploying apps on cloud platforms, every milestone adds clarity to my passion.
    </p>

  <section class="slide-in-right">
    <h2>Vision Ahead</h2>
    <p>
      I aim to build solutions that merge innovation with usability â€” whether it's AI-backed tools that simplify tasks,
      or scalable web platforms that empower users.
      Iâ€™m dedicated to refining my backend engineering skills while expanding into cloud systems, DevOps, and advanced AI integrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, I envision contributing to impactful tech communities,
      mentoring future developers,
      and creating a portfolio that doesnâ€™t just reflect skills â€” but a mindset geared toward growth, empathy, and purpose.
